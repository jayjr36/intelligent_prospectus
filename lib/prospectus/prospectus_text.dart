STATEMENT OF THE RECTOR
Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) was established by the Act of Parliament No.6 of
1997, amended by Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendment) Act. No. 4 of 2023 as a higher
technical training institution in Tanzania. DIT has a vision of becoming a leading technical
education institution in addressing societal needs. The mission of DIT is to provide
competence based technical education, through training, research, innovation and
development of appropriate technology. DIT is an agent of industrialization, a progressive and
customer-centered higher learning institution.
DIT understands that such a mission could only be realized if local technical training
institutions will significantly increase students’ enrolment and improve teaching methodology.
Technical training at DIT is competency based, characterized by the ability to carry out an
occupational activity, but still needs to be consolidated. In order to achieve this, we are
fostering a teaching factory approach whereby technical training is interactively linked to a
real life factory business. This is realized by either establishing a virtual or physical factory.
The former is mainly achieved through industrial linkages. It is also envisioned to couple
training with technology incubators as they provide space, partnerships and networks to build
a national community in which project/research students, innovators, entrepreneurs,
scientists, technologists, professionals and investors can continuously exchange knowledge,
practices, develop innovative businesses and expand their networks locally, regionally and
globally.
Strategies for improving the quality of teaching and learning process are notably vivid in a
good number of curricula developed and reviewed recently. The application of ICT in teaching
is also emphasized in the new curricula. Besides, DIT envisions putting in place support
services for business start-ups for its students after completion of training, and similar
measures for easing labour-entry and job-retention. To facilitate the teaching factory at DIT
staff and students are intermittently attached to industries. Such initiatives are the testimony
of DIT’s willingness and readiness to play a key role in industrialization agenda.
DIT is also planning to increase students’ enrolment from 6000 to 11000 students by 2025
through extending and strengthening its services to various parts of the country including Dar
es Salaam, Mwanza and Songwe regions. We are also glad that the government of Tanzania
has already extended financial support in tune of TZS 74 billion for infrastructure development
and procurement of modern teaching facilities in the two DIT campuses (Dar es Salaam and
iii | P a g e
Mwanza) through a World Bank loan under East Africa Skills for Transformation and Regional
Integration Project (EASTRIP). Currently, DIT offers a wide range of programmes namely
certificates, ordinary diploma, bachelor to master level in the fields of Maintenance
Management, Computing and Communications Technology, Computational Science and
Engineering, Sustainable Energy Engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering,
electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, science and laboratory technology. Other
fields are oil and gas engineering, information technology, mining engineering, biomedical
equipment engineering, communication system technology and renewable energy technology.
Others include multimedia and film technology, biotechnology, Leather products and allied
technologies and food science and technology. Others are Masters’ programmes in Computer
Engineering, Cyber Security and Forensic Investigation, Telecommunications Systems and
network Engineering, Diploma in Industrial Automation, Bachelor of Information Technology,
Bachelor of Multimedia and Film Technology and Bachelor of Biomedical Engineering. The
newly developed Doctor of Technology (DTech) programme is under validation processes by
the NACTVET.
In the current year 2023/2024, DIT will continue strengthening the strategies aimed at
providing competence in applied science and engineering programmes and hands-on practice
through the Teaching Factory concept. The Institute will keep on improving learning
environment, which is key for nurturing critical thinking skills and personal development to
enhance knowledge based economic growth in the country.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
Brief Information about DIT
The Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) is located in the Dar es Salaam city
centre, at the junction of Morogoro Road and Bibi Titi Mohamed Street. DIT was
established in 1997 by the Act of Parliament, “the DIT Act No.6 of 1997” to replace the Dar
es Salaam Technical College, which had a long history of technical training in Tanzania.
This history dates back to 1957 when its predecessor; the Dar es Salaam Technical
Institute was established aiming at providing vocational training in the country. The
Institute later expanded its scope to offer technical secondary school courses and training
for Technical Assistants before it was upgraded in 1962 to become the Dar es Salaam
Technical College (DTC), the first formal technical training institution in the country.
One of the responsibilities of DTC was to train technicians under the London City and Guilds
Training Program. In order to enhance its contribution to the national capacity building in
technical manpower, the College in 1964 introduced two-and-a-half-year Ordinary
Technician Diploma (OTD) programmes in Civil, Electrical, Telecommunications and
Mechanical Engineering. These were later upgraded into three-year Full Technician
Certificate (FTC) courses in 1970/1.
Later, the College also introduced Diploma in Engineering (DE) programmes in the four
traditional engineering disciplines to provide post-FTC technical training. Courses for
Laboratory Technology and Diploma in Technical Education (DTE) were also introduced in
1962. The position of DTC in the provision of higher technical education was consolidated
in 1991 when the corresponding Advanced Diploma in Engineering (ADE) programmes
replaced the Diploma in Engineering (DE) courses. Today, DIT, DE and ADE graduates can
be found in almost all engineering firms/institutions. There are positive feedbacks from the
respective employers indicating overall good performance by ADE graduates.
The current political and economic trends, as well as the new technological changes have
increased competition in the demand for, and supply of quality products including technical
education and services. Under such a competitive environment, the leading position of DTC
in the provision of higher technical education could not be sustained for long given its old
1|P age
set-up and mission. Hence a new institution was therefore necessary to replace the Dar es
Salaam Technical College. Such an institution could effectively address the current
technological developments, provide competitive academic outputs in terms of quality
technical training, applied research and expertise services to the community. The Dar es
Salaam Institute of Technology was therefore established in 1997 to realize that aspiration,
as guided by its vision and mission.
DIT is a fully accredited by the National Council for Technical Education (NACTE). Currently,
DIT offers a wide range of full-time, part-time and professional applied sciences and
engineering training courses /programmes. The Institute has replaced the FTC and ADE
programmes with Ordinary Diploma and Bachelor of Engineering programmes respectively.
In addition, the Institute has started offering Bachelor of Technology in Laboratory Sciences
and some courses in master programmes: Master in Computational Science and
Engineering, Master of technology in Computing and Communications, Master of
Engineering in Maintenance Management and Master of Engineering in Sustainable Energy
Engineering. Other courses are Bachelor of Mining Engineering and Bachelor of Oil and Gas
and Diploma programmes in Biotechnology, Food Science and Technology, Multimedia and
Film technology, Information Communication Technology and Communication Systems
technology.
Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology has three campuses in Dar es Salaam, Mwanza and
Songwe regions. Dar es Salaam Main Campus offers a wide range of full and part time in
applied science engineering and professional training programmes leading to the awards of
Ordinary Diploma, Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Technology and Master Degree
programmes. These programmes are offered by six academic Departments namely, Civil
Department, Electrical Department, Electronics & Telecommunications Department,
Mechanical Department, Computer Studies Department, and Laboratory Science &
Technology Department. The General Studies Department supports the academic
departments through teaching Mathematics, Communications Skills, Research and
Entrepreneurship Education modules. In addition, various short term professional training
courses are offered by DIT through the Institute Consultancy Bureau (ICB) and the IndiaTanzania Center of Excellency in Information Communication Technology (ITCoEICT).
Currently, DIT Mwanza campus offers Ordinary Diploma courses in Science and Laboratory
Technology and Leather Products Technology. DIT Myunga campus in Songwe region is
offering Vocational Training Programmes on Plumbing and Pipe Fitting (PL) and Information
Communication Technology (ICT) and various professional short training programs.
2|P age
The expectations of Tanzanians towards DIT are very high because of the impact of
producing graduates who meet the market demand. As expressed in the National Technical
Education and Training Policy of 1996, National Higher Education Policy of 1999 and
Tanzania Development Vision 2025, advancement in science and technology is a key area
of focus for its positive impact to social economic growth as it ensures a knowledge-based
economic growth. In order for DIT to match with its new structure, roles and functions,
current market demand, training curricula are reviewed after every five years to incorporate
various stakeholders’ views.
This prospectus therefore, describes the main features of the DIT in line with customers
and stakeholders’ interests. It provides an outline of academic programmes, admission
requirements, procedures and regulations to be met for one to get admission and graduate
at the Institute. In addition, examination regulations, course programmes, course duration,
list of academic staff and other relevant information are also provided.
1.2
Organization Structure of DIT

providing materials and documentation services to support teaching and learning activities.
The collections include materials for major courses in the fields of Electrical Engineering,
Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering,
Laboratory Technology and Computer studies. Also, it offers materials for supporting
subjects such as Mathematics, Communication Skills, Development Studies, Labour Law and
Engineering Management. According to the statistics of the previous stocktaking the library
has a total number of 3,727 documents. These include up-to-date textbooks, professional
journals, theses, manuals, bibliographies, reports, research papers, and handbooks.
Membership: Any person attending a course or working at DIT is entitled to the use of the
library services, and therefore allowed to register him/ herself as a member. The library

GENERAL INFORMATION
9.1 BEST STUDENTS’ PRIZES AND AWARDS
In order to promote learning competitions among
students, the Institute, award prizes to the best three
students in each academic department who show
outstanding academic performance in all the subjects
carried out in an academic year.. In addition, other
prizes are awarded by different sponsors (individuals
and companies) to best students in various fields.
Information regarding awards and prizes will be
released to students by the DIT management before
the graduation day of each academic year.

9.2 STUDENTS’ ACCOMMODATION
Currently, DIT has a limited number of rooms in its hostels to provide accommodation to all
students. Students are encouraged to look for private accommodation in the city. For the
limited accommodation spaces available, Institute Students Accommodation Bureau (ISAB)
will use criteria stipulated in accommodation policy in allocation accommodation for
students preferentially for those who have applied for accommodation from ISAB.
Students’ hostels are located within the DIT compound and Chang’ombe area.
Student who will secure accommodation in DIT hostels are required to bring with them;
pillows, bed sheets, blanket and mosquito nets. Every student shall, before being granted
institutes’ accommodation pay a prescribed accommodation fee.
241  
Every resident student shall observe accommodation rules and regulations. These include,
but not limited to, the strict requirement for all students to vacate their rooms and handover their room keys to the janitor/warden during vacation and industrial practical training
periods. Residents are not allowed to sublet, use illegal drugs as well as not to cook in
hostels or employ house girls/boys for cooking and laundry duties.

9.3
STUDENTS’ ADMINISTRATION
Most of the students’ activities at the Institute are organized by the DIT Students
Organisation (DITSO) under the coordination of the Office of the Dean of Students. The
Organisation is concerned with the student’s academic, political, social and recreational
activities. Every student becomes a member of DITSO (DIT Student Organization) and
students are advised to make their academic life meaningful by making their organization
contribute positively towards the Institute Vision, Mission and its objectives.

9.4 STUDENTS’ CATERING SERVICES
NTA Level 4-6 students are not paid meal allowances, instead, meals are provided by the
Institute in a dining hall located in the campus. Menu depends on the ability of the
sponsor. B.Eng students obtain their meals from a number of points providing catering
services within the proximity of the Institute. The same applies to all day and private
sponsored students.

9.5 MEDICAL SERVICES
The Institute has a health care unit for students, staff and their families. The unit provides
outpatient services to NHIF members and on cost sharing basis to non-NHIF members and
may refer to other hospitals if necessary. Students are encouraged to bring with them NHIF
cards and for non-members a special health insurance package for students has been
introduced by the NHIF. Each non-member student should make early consultation with the
institute students NHIF officer to get registration forms for students to fill. Currently, the
242  
amount to be paid by individual student is TZS 50,400/= per academic year. The amount to
be paid regarding medical insurance cover is clearly stipulated in the college fee’s structure.
Students are directed to report at the health care unit each time before they embark for any
referral treatment.

9.6 GENDER MANAGEMENT UNIT (GMU)
The DIT- Gender Management Unit (DIT_GMU) was established in 2000 to advocate all the
gender related issues at DIT including gender equity and efficiency in education and
training. GMU recognizes and addresses gender issues and problems as stipulated in the
DIT corporate strategic plan.
The DIT-GMU closely works with the management in an attempt to intensify efforts to admit
more qualified female students and recruit female staff to address gender imbalance. It also
